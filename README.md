# Competitive-Coding-Programs
This repo consists of some of the basic programs to get started in the world of competitive coding. All the programs are written in the C++ and java language 
but they are simple so as to facilitate the porting to other languages as well. These problems are meant as a starting point for your competitive 
programming journey and a sort of guide book for some of the basic concepts and techniques to face these problems.
